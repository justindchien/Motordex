# Motordex
You can read more about the project on [my blog post](www.justindchien.com/blog/motordex).

The app folder contains the Flask application you can run on the local server (default port 9000).
Note: Keras h5 models can be downloaded from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-LdLn5YkfNUbW9mRFRXdWRhQVU).

Final_code.ipynb contains the code used in training, testing, and experimenting in the project. The convolutional neural net training and testing was done on an AWS GPU instance.
